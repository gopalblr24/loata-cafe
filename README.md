# Loata Cafe — Static Website

A cozy, responsive single-page website for Loata Cafe with homepage, menu, about, and contact sections.

Files created:

- `index.html` — main page with sections and nav
- `styles.css` — site styles
- `script.js` — small JS for form feedback and year
- `assets/coffee.svg`, `assets/bakery.svg` — small illustrative SVGs

How to view locally (Windows cmd.exe):

Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve over a simple local server:

```cmd
# If you have Python 3 installed
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/
```

Or use VS Code Live Server extension.

Next steps you might want to do:

- Replace placeholder address and contact details in `index.html`.
- Add real photos in `assets/` and update markup.
- Wire the contact form to a backend or a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.).
